# Guestbook 101

This Lab uses technologies learned in loopback101, docker101, kube101, helm101, istio101, devops101, apiconnect101, but applies all these technologies from the point of view of a microservices developer. This way, you might touch each technology less deep as in the specific labs, but you will use all technologices more holistically or cohesively in a realist agile app development lifecycle.


## Labs

* Lab0 - Create the Guestbook API App using Loopback 3 and OpenAPI version 2.0, see [Lab0](Lab0/README.md)
* Lab1 - Deploy Guestbook API App to Kubernetes using Bash, see [Lab1](Lab1/README.md)
* Lab2 - Secure Guestbook API with API Connect and AppID


## TODO 

* Lab3 - Create a CI/CD Pipeline to Kubernetes
* Lab4 - Use Helm for Deployment
* Lab5 - Using Istio
